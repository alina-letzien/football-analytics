# YOLO Configuration
YOLO_CONFIG = {

    "confidence_threshold": 0.5,
    "iou_threshold": 0.45,

# Team Assignment Configuration

    "kmeans_random_state": 42,
    "color_sample_frames": 10,        # Number of early frames to aggregate jersey colors from
    "min_confidence_threshold": 0.15, # Relative margin below which assignment is UNKNOWN (team 0)
    # Override the rendering color for a team (BGR tuple). Leave empty — KMeans picks colors
    # automatically from jersey crops and works well when kits are visually distinct.
    #
    # Use this when:
    #   1. The team label is swapped (T1 draws yellow boxes on white-kit players) — run once
    #      without overrides to see which cluster ID maps to which team, then remap.
    #   2. You want a more vivid display color than the dull average KMeans found.
    #
    # Example — white kits for T1, yellow kits for T2 (BGR):
    #   "team_color_overrides": {1: (230, 230, 230), 2: (0, 215, 255)}
    #
    # Note: overrides only affect bounding-box rendering color, not which cluster a player
    # is assigned to. For genuinely similar kits where players are being misclassified,
    # raise min_confidence_threshold (more players get UNKNOWN instead of a wrong team)
    # or raise color_sample_frames to give KMeans more data to work with.
